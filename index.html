            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Born and raised in Chicago, I moved to Harrisburg to get my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Now, I am
              moving to San Francisco to join Moody's Analytics as an Associate Software Engineer.</p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">I come from a family of polish immigrants. My mother came to the states while 8 months pregnant with me and
              I was born at Rush Hospital Chicago. My family moved around different parts of the city until finally settling
              in the west side suburbs where I attended high school.</p>
            <h4 class="light">
              <i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 40px;">class</i>Education</h4>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">While I always had a fascination with computers, I did not know what to pursue after graduating high school.
              After taking an AP Computer Science course my last semester, I discovered the power of coding and that
              I may actually be good at it. Since software development is a rising market, I decided to give it a go.
            </p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
              I decided to make the move to Penn State Harrisburg to pursue a Computer Science degree. The more I learned about the math
              and logic behind coding, the more I realized that this would be my career. While I worked to master the theory,
              I hungered to learn practical and modern applications. I attended FullStack Academy Chicago the summer of 2017,
              a rigorous course that taught me full stack web development using JavaScript.

              I collaborated with 5 other students to create KittyPath, a Google Chrome extension meant to aggregate all of Penn State's
              scheduling info into one place. We observed that the current scheduling site, LionPath, is slow and the user
              must look in many different places to get the information they need. With KittyPath, the user installs the
              extension, navigates to their LionPath Academic requirements once, and the extension pulls all of the relevant
              information using a content script. The user can then view their requirements to graduate, look up courses offered
              next semester, and even get recommendations based on what is available and their recommended academic plan.
              Users can save courses for later, and have the extension directly inject the courses to their LionPath schedule
              Builder.
